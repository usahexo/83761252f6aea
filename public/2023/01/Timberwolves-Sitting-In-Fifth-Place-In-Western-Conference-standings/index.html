        <h1 id="Timberwolves-Sitting-In-Fifth-Place-In-Western-Conference-standings"><a href="#Timberwolves-Sitting-In-Fifth-Place-In-Western-Conference-standings" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Sitting In Fifth Place In Western Conference standings"></a>Timberwolves Sitting In Fifth Place In Western Conference standings</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves find themselves in a peculiar position as the All-Star break nears. Sitting in 5th place in the Western Conference standings, many observers would have guessed that the T-Wolves would be much lower in the standings. However, with Jimmy Butler sidelined and Andrew Wiggins slumping, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Karl Anthony-Towns has been a bright spot for the Timberwolves this season. He is averaging 23 points and 12 rebounds per game and has been named an All-Star for the 2nd year in a row. Towns’ play is crucial for the Timberwolves if they hope to make a playoff run this season.</p>
<p>A number of other Timberwolves players have also stepped up this season. Derrick Rose has averaged 18 points and 4 assists per game, while Taj Gibson has averaged 12 points and 6 rebounds per game. Jeff Teague has averaged 13 points and 7 assists per game, providing much-needed stability at point guard.</p>
<p>Andrew Wiggins, who was recently named an All-Star starter, has been disappointing this season. He is averaging 17 points per game but is shooting just 41% from the field and 28% from 3-point range. Wiggins’ inconsistency has been a big reason why the Timberwolves have struggled offensively this season.</p>
<p>Jimmy Butler’s absence has also been felt by the Timberwolves. Butler, who was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers earlier in the season, was averaging 22 points per game before getting injured. The 76ers are currently in first place in the Eastern Conference standings, so it is clear that Butler was an important player for them.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves will need to figure out how to win without Butler if they want to make a playoff run this season. They have already shown that they are capable of doing so, as they have gone 8-5 since Butler was traded away. However, they will need to continue playing well if they want to catch up to the Houston Rockets or Golden State Warriors in the standings.</p>
<h1 id="Timberwolves-Hold-Third-Place-In-NBA’s-Midwest-Division"><a href="#Timberwolves-Hold-Third-Place-In-NBA’s-Midwest-Division" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Hold Third Place In NBA’s Midwest Division"></a>Timberwolves Hold Third Place In NBA’s Midwest Division</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves are currently in third place in the NBA’s Midwest division with a record of 41-30. They have come a long way since last season when they finished with the worst record in the league. Some of their success can be attributed to Jimmy Butler, who was acquired from the Chicago Bulls before the start of this season.</p>
<p>Butler has been a key player for the Timberwolves, averaging 22 points per game. He has also been very effective on defense, averaging 1.8 steals per game. Other players contributing to the Timberwolves’ success include Karl-Anthony Towns, who is averaging 21 points and 12 rebounds per game, and Andrew Wiggins, who is averaging 17 points per game.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves have had some impressive wins this season, including a victory over the Golden State Warriors and a win over the Houston Rockets. They are currently in sixth place in the Western Conference playoff standings and have a chance of making it to the postseason. If they do make it to the playoffs, they will likely be facing one of the top teams in the West such as the Golden State Warriors or the Houston Rockets. However, they have proved that they can compete with any team in the league, so anything is possible.</p>
<h1 id="Timberwolves-Ranked-Seventh-In-League-In-Scoring-Offense"><a href="#Timberwolves-Ranked-Seventh-In-League-In-Scoring-Offense" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Ranked Seventh In League In Scoring Offense"></a>Timberwolves Ranked Seventh In League In Scoring Offense</h1><p>Minnesota Timberwolves Ranked Seventh In League In Scoring Offense</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves offense is a juggernaut. Led by All-Star Jimmy Butler and 2017 Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins, the Timberwolves are seventh in the league in scoring offense with 108.8 points per game.</p>
<p>Butler is averaging 22.9 points per game, which is good for fourth in the league. Wiggins is averaging 18.6 points per game, and Karl-Anthony Towns is averaging 20.4 points per game. Towns is also averaging 12.3 rebounds per game, which leads the league.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves have six players who are averaging 10 or more points per game, which makes them one of the deepest teams in the NBA. They also have a lot of young talent, which makes them a team to watch out for in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Wiggins-Towns-Among-NBA’s-Most-Improved-Players"><a href="#Wiggins-Towns-Among-NBA’s-Most-Improved-Players" class="headerlink" title="Wiggins, Towns Among NBA’s Most Improved Players"></a>Wiggins, Towns Among NBA’s Most Improved Players</h1><p>The NBA season is heating up, and with it, the race for the playoffs. As teams jockey for position, players are stepping up to make their cases for postseason awards. While there are many contenders for most improved player, a few stand out above the rest.</p>
<p>In particular, Andrew Wiggins of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Karl-Anthony Towns of the Timberwolves have been on fire this season. Wiggins is averaging over 23 points per game, up from 17 last year. Towns, meanwhile, is averaging nearly 27 points and 12 rebounds per game. Both are in the top 10 in scoring this season.</p>
<p>What’s even more impressive is that Wiggins and Towns are only in their second and first years in the league, respectively. They’ve both made big strides this year to become some of the NBA’s top players.</p>
<p>It’s not just their scoring that’s impressive; they’re also two of the best defenders in the league. Wiggins was recently named to the All-Defensive second team, while Towns earned third-team honors.</p>
<p>What’s most amazing about Wiggins and Towns is that they’re still improving at such a rapid pace. There’s no telling how good they could be by seasons end or in future years. The sky is truly the limit for these two young stars.</p>
<h1 id="Teague-Crawford-Leading-Timberwolves’-Playoff-Push"><a href="#Teague-Crawford-Leading-Timberwolves’-Playoff-Push" class="headerlink" title="Teague, Crawford Leading Timberwolves’ Playoff Push"></a>Teague, Crawford Leading Timberwolves’ Playoff Push</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have turned their season around after trading Jimmy Butler and seem to be playing their best basketball at the right time. Led by Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, the Timberwolves are in sixth place in the Western Conference with a record of 43-35. They have gone 25-11 since January 8th, which is the best record in the NBA over that span.</p>
<p>Teague has been one of the most underrated players in the NBA this season. He is averaging 14.8 points and 7.5 assists per game while shooting 47 percent from the field. Crawford has also played well, averaging 10.3 points per game off the bench. He is a three-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner and is a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves will need to continue playing well if they want to make it to the playoffs. They are currently tied with the Denver Nuggets for sixth place in the West, but they hold the tiebreaker because they have won two of three head-to-head matchups between the two teams. The Clippers, Jazz, and Spurs are all close behind them and could overtake them if they falter down the stretch.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves will face some tough tests in their final nine games of the season. They play six games against teams currently in playoff position (Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors, Oklahoma City Thunder, Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz, San Antonio Spurs) and three games against teams that are on the outside looking in (Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Phoenix Suns).</p>
<p>If they can manage to win four or five of their last nine games, they should be safely in to the playoffs as either the sixth or seventh seed. If they stumble down the stretch and lose a few key games, they could find themselves on the outside looking in when all is said and done.</p>
