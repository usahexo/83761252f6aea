Michigan is gearing up to become the next US state to offer online casino gambling, with Goldbet at the forefront of the market.

While there has been no official confirmation from the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) as yet, it is widely expected that the board will give the go-ahead for online casinos in the very near future.
