#  What do people in Arizona think of the Diamondbacks?

The Arizona Diamondbacks have been a part of the state since 1998 and, since that time, they have been one of the most popular sports teams in Arizona. This is largely due to the fact that they are one of the only teams in the state and they have had a great deal of success over the years.

The Diamondbacks first season was a bit rough, but they quickly improved and made it to the playoffs in their third season. They went on to win the World Series in 2001, which cemented their place as one of the most popular teams in Arizona.

Since then, they have made it to the playoffs several times but have not been able to win another World Series. Regardless, fans continue to support them and they remain one of the most popular teams in Arizona. This is something that is likely to continue for many years to come.

#  What did Brigitte Bardot once say about sex?

"Sex is a moment of happiness that can never be repeated."

This quote by Brigitte Bardot seems to sum up the feeling many people have about sex. It's a brief moment of happiness that can never be duplicated. For some, this is what makes sex so special and intriguing. They want to experience that intense happiness again and again.

For others, this quote may be seen as a warning. Sex can be very addictive and it's easy to get wrapped up in it. Once you've experienced that intense happiness, it's hard to go back to anything else. You may find yourself constantly chasing after that feeling, without ever really finding it again.

#  How popular are Diamondbacks games in comparison to other MLB games?

In the 2017 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks had an attendance of 2,523,413 people. This was good for 5th in the MLB. The Seattle Mariners had the most attendance with 3,592,718 people. This is a difference of 1,069,305 people. That is a lot of people!

The Diamondbacks are a fairly popular team in comparison to other MLB teams. Their attendance is better than 16 other teams and worse than 14 other teams. This shows that they are a good team but not the best.

There are a few explanations as to why the Diamondbacks’ attendance may be lower than other teams. One reason could be that they are a newer team. The Mariners have been around since 1977 while the Diamondbacks were founded in 1998. Therefore, some fans may not have as strong of a connection to the Diamondbacks as they do to other teams.

Another explanation could be that Arizona is not a traditional baseball market like New York or Los Angeles. These cities have larger populations which could lead to more fans attending games. Additionally, these cities also have more teams competing for attention so it may be harder for the Diamondbacks to stand out.

Despite these possible explanations, the Diamondbacks’ attendance is still among the top in the MLB. This shows that they are a popular team and have many fans across the country.
