#  Vegas-Style Casino Slated to Open in Maryland

A new Vegas-style casino is slated to open in Maryland, just outside of Washington D.C. The $1.3 billion casino will be the largest in the state, and is expected to bring in hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

The casino will feature a number of luxury amenities, including a spa, a fitness center, and several restaurants. There will also be a large gambling hall, with slot machines and gaming tables.

The casino is being built by MGM Resorts International, which already operates casinos in Las Vegas and other major U.S. cities. The company is hoping to replicate its success in Maryland, where gambling is already popular.

Opponents of the new casino say that it will lead to increased crime and traffic congestion in the area. But supporters argue that the jobs and economic benefits it will bring outweigh any potential negatives.

Either way, the new casino is sure to be a major attraction for visitors to the region.

#  National Harbor's First Casino to Open in November

The opening of the MGM National Harbor casino this November is set to be a major event for both the city of National Harbor and the surrounding region. With its completion, National Harbor will become the only jurisdiction in Maryland with both a casino and a convention center. The new facility is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state.

The MGM National Harbor casino is a $1.4 billion project that has been under development for more than four years. It will feature a 24-story luxury hotel, three restaurants, shops, and a 2,000-seat theater. The casino will offer nearly 125,000 square feet of gaming space, including 3,600 slot machines and over 200 gaming tables.

In addition to its gaming facilities, the MGM National Harbor casino will also be home to one of the region's largest banquet halls. The hall can accommodate up to 6,000 guests and will be used for weddings, conferences, and other special events.

The opening of the MGM National Harbor casino is not only good news for National Harbor; it is also good news for Prince George's County as a whole. The county currently has the highest poverty rate in Maryland and one of the lowest median household incomes. The casino is expected to create 5,000 construction jobs and 4,000 permanent jobs in Prince George's County alone.

In addition to generating much-needed revenue for the county, the casino is also expected to attract tourists from all over the region. With its proximity to Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Annapolis, National Harbor is well positioned to become a major destination for visitors from all over Maryland and beyond.

#  casino resort set to debut at National Harbor this fall

# Plans include MGM’s first Ferris wheel

An all-new casino resort is set to debut this fall at National Harbor, just south of Washington D.C. MGM Resorts International is behind the $1.4 billion development, which will include a 300-room hotel, 50,000 square feet of gaming space, and the company’s first Ferris wheel.

National Harbor has been a popular gambling destination since it opened in 2008, and the new MGM property is expected to draw even more visitors. The resort will be marketed to locals and tourists alike, with plans for a celebrity chef restaurant and an entertainment district overlooking the Potomac River.

MGM has been expanding rapidly in recent years, with new properties coming online in Las Vegas, Macau, and Singapore. The company is also developing a casino resort in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is expected to open in late 2018.

#  MGM Resorts Plans November Opening for Nation Harbor casino

MGM Resorts International plans to open its new $1.3 billion casino in the Washington D.C. suburb of National Harbor in November, the company said on Wednesday.

The casino, which MGM has been developing with The Cordish Cos., will have more than 100,000 square feet of gaming space, 3,000 slots and video poker machines, 180 table games and a 30-table poker room. It will also have an 11-theater cinema, a 2,200-seat concert hall and a 300-room luxury hotel.

“National Harbor is the most exciting destination on the East Coast and MGM Resorts is excited to be part of it,” Bill Hornbuckle, president of MGM Resorts International, said in a statement.

The casino is expected to create 1,500 jobs.

MGM first announced its plan to build at National Harbor in February 2013. The project ran into delays after Maryland regulators said they wanted the casino to be smaller and include a hotel that met certain criteria. In March this year MGM agreed to cut the size of the casino by about a quarter and make other changes in order to win approval from the state.

National Harbor is located about 5 miles south of downtown Washington on the shores of the Potomac River. It has become a popular destination for tourists and locals since it opened in 2008 with shops and restaurants. The Maryland Live! casino is also located there.

#  Plans move ahead for $1B casino resort at National Harbor

A development group led by MGM Resorts International has cleared its final major regulatory hurdle in its plans to build a $1 billion casino and resort complex at National Harbor.

The Prince George's County Council voted unanimously Monday to approve zoning changes for the project, which is expected to create 4,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent positions.

MGM plans to open the facility in 2016. It would be the largest gambling venue in Maryland and one of the largest in the country.

National Harbor is located on the Potomac River across from Alexandria, Va. The development includes hotels, restaurants and retail shops.

Prince George's County officials have praised MGM's plans for the casino resort, saying it would generate much-needed revenue for the county and create jobs. Some residents and religious leaders have raised concerns about the impact of a large casino on the community.
