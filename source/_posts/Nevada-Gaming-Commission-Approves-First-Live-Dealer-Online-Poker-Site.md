#  Nevada Gaming Commission Approves First Live Dealer Online Poker Site

The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the green light to the first live dealer online poker site. The new site, which is yet to be announced, will allow players in Nevada to sit down at a table and play poker against live dealers.

The move is seen as a major step forward for the online poker industry, as it allows players to experience all the excitement of live casino gaming from the comfort of their own homes. Players will be able to chat with the dealers and other players around the table, and even tip them if they enjoy the experience.

The site will initially offer blackjack and roulette games, with more games being added in the future. The company behind the site is expected to announce further details in the coming weeks.
