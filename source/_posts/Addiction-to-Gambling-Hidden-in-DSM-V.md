#  Addiction to Gambling Hidden in DSM-V

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the go-to source for mental health professionals diagnosing and treating patients. Released in May, 2013, DSM-5 has a section on gambling disorder, formerly known as pathological gambling. Gambling disorder is defined in the manual as compulsive gambling, which is "a persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family, or occupational functioning."

Despite this clear definition, there is growing concern among mental health professionals that the DSM-5 definition of gambling disorder may be too narrow and may not accurately capture all those who struggle with problem gambling. In particular, some experts are worried that the inclusion of "disrupts personal, family, or occupational functioning" in the definition could exclude many people with a serious gambling problem from getting help.

To date, there is no good epidemiological data on how common problem gambling is in the United States. However, studies from other countries suggest that problem gambling may be quite common. For example, a study from Australia estimated that about 1% of the population had a severe gambling problem (i.e., they met criteria for pathological gambling). Another study from Sweden found that 1.5% of the population had a significant problem with gambling.

So why is it so important to accurately diagnose problem gambling? The answer lies in the potential seriousness of the condition. Problem gamblers are at risk for a wide range of negative consequences including financial hardship, relationship problems, job loss, and even suicide. In fact, research suggests that problem gamblers are two to three times more likely than non-problem gamblers to attempt suicide.

Given the seriousness of problem gambling, it's important that we have an accurate diagnosis criteria for identifying those who need help. The DSM-5 definition of gambling disorder is a good start but may need some revision to ensure that everyone who needs help can get it.

#  Gambling addiction rates on the rise, hidden in DSM-V

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) includes gambling disorder as a mental disorder for the first time. The inclusion reflects the growing body of evidence that gambling can be addictive and harmful to individuals and families.

Gambling disorder is classified in the addictive disorders section of DSM-5 and is characterized by persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior. Causal beliefs about gambling, such as the idea that it can help one make money or achieve excitement, are often endorsed by people with this disorder.

Gambling disorder can have serious consequences for individuals and their loved ones. Financial problems, legal issues, and emotional distress are common outcomes of gambling addiction. Relationships can be damaged through stealing or lying to cover up gambling activity. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are also more common in people with gambling disorder.

The new classification of gambling disorder in DSM-5 will help increase awareness of the problem and may lead to more people seeking treatment. Gambling disorder is a treatable condition, but unfortunately many people do not seek help because of the stigma associated with addiction. Treatment options include individual or group therapy, medication, or self-help groups such as Gamblers Anonymous.

The inclusion of gambling disorder in DSM-5 is an important step in recognizing this serious public health problem. It is hoped that this will lead to increased awareness and prevention efforts as well as improved access to treatment for those affected by this condition.

#  DSM-V Won't List Gambling Addiction as a Mental Disorder

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) will not list gambling addiction as a mental disorder in the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), according to an APA spokesperson.

Gambling addiction was proposed for inclusion in DSM-V by the APA's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, but the proposal was rejected by a majority of the APA's Board of Trustees.

"After careful consideration of all the available information, the Board determined that gambling disorder is not sufficiently well understood to be included in DSM-5 at this time," said Dr. David J. Kupfer, chairman of the DSM-5 Task Force.

Gambling addiction is a serious mental disorder that can lead to financial ruin and even suicide, but it has not been studied extensively enough to warrant inclusion in DSM-V, according to the APA.

The decision to exclude gambling addiction from DSM-V has caused outrage among some mental health professionals and gambling addicts who argue that the disorder is real and should be treated like any other addiction.

"This is a devastating blow to people with a gambling addiction," said Rich Meyers, president of Gambling Recovery Services. "Without a diagnosis, they will have a difficult time getting help from their doctor or getting coverage for treatment."

The fifth edition of DSM is due to be released in May 2013.
