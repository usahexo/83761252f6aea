#  When Is Mobile Sports Betting Legal In New York?

For those who are looking to engage in some sports betting action, but are unsure of where to do so, the great state of New York offers a few viable options. Legal mobile sports betting is offered by both FanDuel and DraftKings, both of which have launched their own mobile apps. However, there are some nuances which bettors should be aware of before placing any wagers.

The first thing to consider is that, while sports betting is legal in New York, only parlay bets are currently allowed. This means that you can only bet on two or more games at a time, and your potential payout increases with the number of games you bet on. Additionally, online and mobile sports betting licenses are only available to land-based casinos in the state. So if you're not located near one of these casinos, you'll need to find an off-shore site which accepts New York residents.

When it comes to legality, things can get a bit hairy. The law in New York dictates that any form of gambling taking place over the internet is illegal. However, this only applies to operators, and not individual bettors. As long as you're placing your bets within the borders of New York, you're golden. And even if you're crossing state lines to place a bet with an off-shore site, as long as that site accepts New York residents, you're still good to go.

So what are the best options for mobile sports betting in New York? If you're located near a land-based casino, then DraftKings and FanDuel both offer excellent mobile apps which will allow you to place parlay bets on all the latest sporting events. If you don't live near a casino, or would prefer an off-shore site which offers better odds and more betting options, then Bovada Sportsbook is probably your best option. They accept New York residents and offer a wide range of betting options for major sporting events.

#  When Is Mobile Sports Betting Legal In Utah?

On July 1, 2019, mobile sports betting became legal in Utah. This makes Utah the 16th state to legalize some form of sports betting.

But when is mobile sports betting actually going to be available in Utah? That’s a bit of a trickier question to answer.

So far, no specific date has been announced for when mobile sports betting will go live in Utah. However, we can make some educated guesses based on what we know about the process thus far.

First and foremost, it’s important to note that not all casinos in Utah are going to offer mobile sports betting. Just nine of the state’s 29 casinos have been licensed so far to offer this new form of gambling.

Those nine casinos are likely the ones that will have mobile sports betting up and running first. But even within those nine casinos, there’s no telling exactly when mobile sports betting will go live.

It could be a few weeks or even a month after July 1 before anyone is able to place a bet on their phone or tablet. However, it’s also possible that we won’t see any major roll-outs until later in the summer or even early fall.

So what should you do if you want to bet on sports in Utah? Unfortunately, your only option for now is to head to one of the nine casinos that have been licensed for mobile betting. But keep an eye out for announcements about specific launch dates, as that information will start becoming available in the coming weeks and months.

#  New York Set To Regulate Mobile Sports Betting

 On Monday, November 13th, the New York State Gaming Commission voted unanimously to approve regulations for mobile sports betting. This decision came just two weeks after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had prohibited sports betting in most states.

"The State Gaming Commission has responsibly moved forward to adopt sensible regulations that will permit authorized commercial gaming entities to offer mobile sports betting," said acting commissioner Kevin O'Flaherty in a statement. "These regulations provide much-needed consumer protections while also allowing innovation in an exciting new area of gambling."

Under the new regulations, mobile sports betting will be restricted to those 21 and older. Players will also be required to create an account with a licensed gambling operator and set a daily spending limit. Operators will be prohibited from offering free bets or other promotions that could encourage players to bet more than they can afford.

The regulations also require operators to share detailed data on bets with state authorities, including who is placing them, how much is being wagered, and which sporting events are being bet on. This information will help the commission track problem gambling and ensure that games are fair and credible.

 "These regulations represent another significant step in the implementation of mobile sports betting in New York," said O'Flaherty. "We look forward to working with our authorizing partners as we continue to rollout this new product."

It's unclear exactly when mobile sports betting will be available in New York, but it's expected to launch sometime in 2019. In the meantime, residents can already place bets at land-based casinos or through licensed offshore operators.

#  Utah Jazz Move Forward With Mobile Sports Betting

Utah Jazz fans will now be able to place bets on their favorite team through their mobile devices. The Utah Jazz has partnered with SBTech, a global sports betting provider, to offer mobile sports betting in the state of Utah.

The launch of the Utah Jazz mobile sports betting app took place on January 21, 2019. The app will offer bettors the ability to bet on all major sporting events, including NBA games, NCAA basketball games, and NFL games. In addition to live betting, the app will also offer pre-match and futures bets.

The Utah Jazz mobile sports betting app is available for download through the App Store and Google Play. Bettors must be located in the state of Utah in order to place bets on the app.

#  New York, Utah Jazz React To New Mobile Sports Betting Laws

The New York Knicks and Utah Jazz reacted to new mobile sports betting laws this week by prohibiting fans from using their mobile devices to place bets in the arena.

This move comes as a response to the new law passed in New York on Monday that allows for mobile sports betting within the state.

Utah Jazz senior vice president of business operations, Justin Zanik, said the following in a statement: "The Utah Jazz have always been opposed to all forms of gambling, and we will not allow our fans to use their mobile devices to place bets on our games."

 Knicks president Steve Mills said something similar, stating that the team does not condone sports betting and that using phones to bet would violate Madison Square Garden's policy.

It is unclear if other teams in the NBA will follow suit, but it is likely that more teams will prohibit phone betting within their arenas in order to avoid any potential association with gambling.
