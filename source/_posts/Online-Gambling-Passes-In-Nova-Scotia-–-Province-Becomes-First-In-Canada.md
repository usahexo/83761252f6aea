#  Online Gambling Passes In Nova Scotia – Province Becomes First In Canada

Nova Scotia has become the first province in Canada to legalize and regulate online gambling. The new law, passed on October 5th, will come into effect in 2019 and will allow residents of Nova Scotia to gamble on provincial websites.

The move is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the province each year. It is also seen as a way to combat illegal gambling operations, which have been thriving in Nova Scotia in recent years.

Under the new law, online gambling companies will be required to pay a licensing fee and taxes on their profits. They will also be required to ensure that customers are over the age of 19 and that they are located in Nova Scotia.

Nova Scotia is not the only province considering legalizing online gambling. In Ontario, a government-commissioned report released earlier this year recommended that online gambling be legalized and regulated.

Legalizing online gambling has its opponents, who argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, proponents argue that regulating the industry can help protect consumers and generate much-needed revenue for cash-strapped provinces.

#  Online Gambling Legislation Goes Into Effect in Nova Scotia

Gambling laws in Nova Scotia changed on October 17, 2018. The new legislation, called the Nova Scotia Gambling Control Act, sets out the rules for how gambling is to be conducted in the province.

The act replaces the province’s former Lotteries and Gaming Act, which was passed in 1998. The new legislation sets out a number of regulations governing casinos, gaming centres, betting, and lottery tickets. It also creates a new Crown corporation – the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation – to administer and enforce the act.

Among other things, the new act allows for online gambling in Nova Scotia. This has generated some controversy, with some people arguing that it will lead to more problem gambling. But proponents of online gambling argue that it will provide another way for people to gamble responsibly and that it will bring much-needed revenue to the province.

The Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation is already accepting applications from businesses interested in becoming authorized providers of online gambling in the province. So far, five businesses have been approved: Casino Halifax, Casino Sydney, Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, Brantford Charity Casino, and Mohawk Racetrack & Casino. More businesses are expected to be approved in the coming weeks and months.

In order to gamble online in Nova Scotia, residents must be 19 years old or older. They must also be physically located within the province at the time they are gambling. Gambling is not allowed anywhere else in Canada except in three provinces – British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec – where it is regulated by their own provincial gaming authorities.

The Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation has launched a website – PlayNSGCasino.com – where residents can learn more about online gambling in the province and find out which businesses are authorized to offer it.

#  Online gambling now legal in Nova Scotia

Gambling is now a legal recreational activity in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The change in law went into effect on October 17, 2018. This makes Nova Scotia the fourth Canadian jurisdiction to legalize online gambling, after Manitoba, Quebec, and British Columbia.

The legalization of online gambling in Nova Scotia was driven by the desire to protect consumers and to generate revenue for the provincial government. Under the new law, operators must be licensed by the province’s Alcohol and Gaming Authority. Only casinos that are licensed in Nova Scotia will be allowed to offer online gambling products to residents of the province.

Nova Scotia joins a growing number of jurisdictions around the world that are legalizing online gambling. The trend is being driven by a desire to protect consumers and to generate revenue for government coffers. In addition to Canada, other countries that have legalized online gambling include Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, and New Zealand.

#  Legal online gambling comes to Nova Scotia

In early November, 2018, the government of Nova Scotia announced that online gambling would be legalized in the province. This move is expected to increase tourism and revenue for the province, as well as create jobs in the burgeoning industry.

 Legal online gambling will be available through the website PlayNow.com, which is run by British Columbia-based company Great Canadian Gaming Corporation. The site offers a wide range of casino games, including slots, blackjack, roulette and poker.

The legalization of online gambling in Nova Scotia has been opposed by some who argue that it could lead to increased levels of gambling addiction. However, proponents of the move argue that it will provide a safe and regulated option for people who want to gamble online.

Online gambling has been legal in other provinces in Canada for many years, with Manitoba being the first to legalize it back in 1999. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of Canadians who gamble online. A study by the Canadian Gaming Association found that more than 60 percent of Canadian adults have gambled online in some form or another.

Gambling is big business in Canada. In 2017, Canadians spent more than $22 billion on gaming activities. This included spending on traditional casino games such as slots and table games, as well as on sports betting and online casino games.

The legalization of online gambling in Nova Scotia is good news for players and for the local economy alike. It will give players a new option when it comes to enjoying their favourite casino games, and it is also expected to create new jobs in the province.
