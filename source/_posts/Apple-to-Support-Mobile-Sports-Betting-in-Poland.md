#  Apple to Support Mobile Sports Betting in Poland

Apple Inc. is set to support mobile sports betting in Poland after the country’s government approved a new law on the matter. The iPhone maker has teamed up with Israeli firm Sportradar to provide the service, which will be offered through the company’s Apple Wallet app.

The new law, which was passed by the Polish parliament last week, allows both state-owned and private companies to offer sports betting services. It had been initially proposed by the country’s ruling party, PiS, as a way of boosting state revenue.

Apple is expected to launch its sports betting service in Poland in time for the start of the next football season in August. Customers will be able to place bets on a range of sporting events, including soccer, tennis, and horse racing.

Poland is not the only country where Apple is planning to launch a sports betting service. Last month, it was announced that the company had partnered with British bookmaker William Hill to offer a similar service in the UK. The William Hill app will be available on iPhones and iPads from later this year.

The move into sports betting represents a shift for Apple, which has so far focused mainly on providing digital content and services such as music, movies, and books. However, with global spending on sports betting expected to top $500 billion by 2020, it’s no surprise that the company is keen to get a slice of the pie.

It remains to be seen how successful Apple will be in the competitive world of sports betting. However, with its wealth of customer data and experience in providing digital services, it certainly has a good chance of making an impact.

#  Android to Support Mobile Sports Betting in Poland

According to recent reports, Android will soon be supporting mobile sports betting in Poland. This is great news for Polish bettors, who will now have a convenient and easy way to place their bets on their favorite sporting events.

Android's support for mobile sports betting in Poland will likely come in the form of an update to the popular Android operating system. This update will allow Polish bettors to place bets on sporting events directly from their Android devices. In addition, the update will likely include a number of other features that will make betting on sports more convenient and user-friendly.

As of now, it is not clear exactly when Android's support for mobile sports betting in Poland will be released. However, it is expected that the update will be released sometime in early 2019. Once it is released, Polish bettors will be able to take advantage of its many benefits.

One of the main advantages of Android's support for mobile sports betting in Poland is convenience. With this update, bettors will no longer have to visit a physical bookmaker in order to place their bets. Instead, they can do all of their betting from the comfort of their own home or anywhere else they may happen to be.

Additionally, Android's support for mobile sports betting in Poland will likely include a number of helpful features that are not currently available on other platforms. These features could include things like live streaming of sporting events, which would allow bettors to follow the action as it happens. This would give them a more complete betting experience and could help them make more informed decisions about their bets.
