#  How to Play European Roulette Like Brigitte Bardot

In the film “D’Artagnan and three musketeers”, Brigitte Bardot played a role of a charming girl named Charlotte. She was the Duchess of Orleans who taught how to play European Roulette like a pro. In reality, the game is not difficult to play but it can be tricky to win if you don’t know what you are doing.

The key to playing European Roulette like Bardot is to first understand the different types of bets that can be made and then choose the ones that have the best odds of winning. The following are the most common bets that can be made in European Roulette:

- Straight up bet: a bet on a single number
- Split bet: a bet on two adjacent numbers
- Street bet: a bet on three numbers in a row
- Column bet: a bet on 12 numbers at once
- Dozen bet: a bet on 12 numbers from 1 to 12
- Red/black or odd/even bets: these are simple bets on whether the next number will be one of those colors or whether it will be even or odd.

After choosing which type of bets to make, the next step is to place your chips on the table in accordance with those bets. For example, if you want to make a split bet on two numbers, then place your chips on the line between those two numbers. Once all of your bets are placed, it’s time to spin the wheel and see where the ball ends up. If your chosen number comes up, then you win!

Her main advice is to keep your bets small and manageable so that you don’t lose too much money if you do happen to lose. By following these tips, you too can play European Roulette like Brigitte Bardot!

#  Celebrity Secrets: How Brigitte Bardot Plays Roulette

People often ask celebrities how they do what they do. They want to get a glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous, in the hopes that they might uncover some secret or insight that will help them improve their own lives. In this article, we're going to take a look at how Brigitte Bardot plays roulette, and see if we can't learn a thing or two about the game in the process.

Bardot was one of the most popular actresses in France during the 1950s and 1960s. She was known for her sex appeal, as well as her acting skills. She starred in dozens of movies during her career, including major hits like And God Created Woman and Contempt.

In addition to being an actress, Bardot was also known for her love of gambling. She frequently played roulette at casinos throughout Europe, and she developed a number of strategies that helped her win more often than she lost. In this article, we're going to take a look at one of those strategies – Bardot's signature move known as "the Brigitte."

The Brigitte is a simple but effective strategy that Bardot used to increase her chances of winning at roulette. Here's how it works:

First, you need to find a table with even money bets (red or black, odd or even). You then bet $10 on black, and place an additional $10 bet on red. If black wins, you collect your $10 payout on black plus the $10 payout on red – giving you a total profit of $20. If red wins, you lose your $10 bet on black but still collect the $10 payout on red – giving you a total loss of just $10.

This strategy is relatively simple to execute, but it can be quite effective if used correctly. By betting on both black and red simultaneously, you are essentially doubling your chances of winning. The Brigitte is particularly useful when the odds are close to 50/50 – as is often the case with even money bets.

So does this mean that Brigitte Bardot has some sort of magical power over roulette? Not necessarily – but it does show that by using simple strategies like the Brigitte, it's possible to tilt the odds in your favour and increase your chances of winning. So next time you're playing roulette, give this strategy a try and see if it works for you!

#  5 Tricks for Beating the Casino at Roulette, Just Like Brigitte Bardot 

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. From its humble beginnings in 18th century France, roulette has spread to casinos all over the globe. Although the game may appear to be simple, there are a number of tricks that players can use to tilt the odds in their favour. Here are five of the best:

1) Choose a European wheel: American wheels have two zero slots, which gives the casino a bigger edge. If you can find a European wheel with just one zero, your chances of winning increase significantly.

2) Stick to even-money bets: These bets offer the best odds, and they’re easy to make. You can bet on either red or black, or on numbers between 1 and 18 or between 19 and 36.

3) Avoid inside bets: Inside bets (such as betting on particular numbers) offer worse odds than outside bets, so it’s best to avoid them.

4) Use hot and cold numbers: Some numbers are more likely to come up than others. Keep an eye on the hot and cold numbers, and place your bets accordingly.

5) Make multiple bets: This is a risky strategy, but it can pay off big time if you’re lucky. Place several small bets rather than one large bet, and make sure that your total wager is within your budget.

#  How to Mimic Brigitte Bardot's Winning Roulette Strategy

 Legendary French actress Brigitte Bardot was known for her beauty, poise and sex appeal. But she was also a shrewd businesswoman, and one of her most successful ventures was an investment in a roulette strategy that netted her millions.

Bardot's secret was to bet small and consistently on black numbers. This low-risk approach paid off handsomely over time, and anyone can use it to beat the casino at their own game.

First, choose a European roulette wheel with just one zero. This is important, as the odds are in your favour when betting on black. Next, decide how much you're willing to risk on each spin. For beginners, we recommend starting with just $5 or $10 per bet.

Now place your bets on the following black numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21. If any of these come up on the wheel, you'll see a return on your investment of between 36% and 40%.
