#  What was the budget for Casino?

The budget for Casino was $ million.

#  What was the casting process for Casino?

Casino is one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films ever made. It was directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. However, what many people don’t know is the extensive casting process that took place before the film was made.

Scorsese had a very specific vision for Casino and was looking for actors who could not only play their roles convincingly but also look the part. For example, he wanted De Niro to look like a Vegas gangster and Pesci to look like a small-time hood.

The casting process began in 1993 and lasted for several months. In the end, Scorsese casted over 1,000 actors in various roles. Some of the more famous faces included James Woods, Don Rickles, Alan King, and Kevin Pollak.

However, not all of the castings went smoothly. Pesci almost didn’t get the role of Nicky because he was considered too old at 53. And Stone almost lost out on the role of Ginger because she was considered too beautiful for the role.

Despite some initial concerns, the cast ended up being perfect for the film. Casino went on to be nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.

#  How did the producers decide to film in Baltimore?

The Eastern Shore is also home to the Chesapeake Bay, which offers a variety of landscapes and scenery.

The filmmakers also did some research on Baltimore and found that the city had a lot to offer in terms of locations and support for film production. Additionally, Maryland has film tax credits that encouraged the production to shoot in Baltimore.

Finally, the producers were impressed by the Charm City Cares organization, which helps connect local businesses with productions looking for crew members and services. Charm City Cares helped connect the producers with various businesses in Baltimore, which ultimately led to them filming in the city.
