#  Brigitte Bardot: Gambling is a Sin, But There's Room for Forgiveness 

Gambling, for Brigitte Bardot, is nothing less than a sin. The former French film icon has never been one to shy away from her controversial opinions on all sorts of topics, and gambling is no exception. In fact, in a September 2017 interview with the French publication Paris Match, she even went as far as to say that "gambling is a dirty business" and that it should be banned altogether.

But while Bardot may consider gambling a sin, that doesn't mean she's not capable of forgiving those who engage in it. In the same Paris Match interview, she said that "even if someone suffers because of gambling-related problems, I think there is always room for forgiveness." This compassionate attitude is reflective of the kind of person Bardot is at her core: someone who believes in second chances and in the possibility for redemption.

Interestingly enough, Bardot's opinion on gambling seems to have softened somewhat over the years. In a 2003 interview with the Telegraph, she recounted how her husband at the time – Jacques Charrier – had gotten hooked on gambling and lost everything they had. She also spoke about how her son had tried to commit suicide after losing money in a casino. Yet despite all this personal experience with the harms of gambling, Bardot still believes that there is some good to be found in it – something that sets her apart from many other anti-gambling crusaders.

Ultimately, Brigitte Bardot's views on gambling are nuanced and complex. She recognizes both its dangers and its potential benefits, making her an interesting figure to study when it comes to this particular topic.
