#  How Do You Play Blackjack at the Ocean Resort Casino? 

When you walk into Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, it’s easy to feel like a high roller. With rows of glimmering slot machines, elegant gaming tables and an expansive bar, the casino floor is a sight to behold. If you’re looking for some excitement and want to test your luck, blackjack is the game for you.

Ocean Resort Casino offers both American and European blackjack, so you can choose the version that best suits your style. The basic rules are the same for both versions, but there are some key differences. In American blackjack, players can double down on any two cards and can also split pairs. In European blackjack, players can only double down on 10 or 11 and cannot split pairs.

The object of the game is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer also draws cards and must stay within specific values: 17 or higher with at least 3 cards; 16 or lower with at least 4 cards. If the dealer goes over 21, he busts and all players still in the hand win their bets.

To begin a game of blackjack, place your bet by placing chips in the designated area on the table. Once all players have placed their bets, each player is given two cards face up. The dealer then deals one card face up to himself and one card face down to each player (including himself). Play begins with the player to the dealers left and continues clockwise around the table.

Players can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If they hit, they must continue taking cards until they either go over 21 or decide to stand. If the player stands with two cards of identical rank (a pair), they can split their bet evenly between the two hands and receive another card for each hand. When all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals his hidden card and completes his hand according to standard rules. The highest total hand wins the hand unless the dealer has a higher total, in which case he busts and all players still in the hand win their bets.

Blackjack is a fun and exciting game that’s easy to learn but provides plenty of opportunities for strategy and decision-making. So put on your best poker face and head over to Ocean Resort Casino for a thrilling game of blackjack!
