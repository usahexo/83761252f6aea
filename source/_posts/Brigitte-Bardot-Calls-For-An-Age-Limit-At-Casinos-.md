#  Brigitte Bardot Calls For An Age Limit At Casinos 

According to reports, Brigitte Bardot is now urging the French government to set an age limit for casino gambling. The French actress and animal rights activist says that casinos are no place for youngsters, and that they should only be allowed to enter when they reach a certain age.

Brigitte Bardot is a well-known figure in France, and her opinions on various topics often carry a lot of weight. This latest call for a gambling age limit is no exception, and it's likely that the government will take her suggestion into account.

Interestingly, this isn't the first time that Bardot has spoken out about casinos. Back in 2013, she also called for a minimum age requirement, saying that casinos were a "dangerous place" for young people. She added that entering a casino at a young age could lead to addiction and financial problems.

So why is Bardot so concerned about casinos? Well, reportedly she's worried about the potential negative effects that they can have on young people. In particular, she's concerned about the addictive nature of gambling, and how it can easily lead to serious financial problems.

 Casinos aren't currently regulated in France in terms of an age limit, so it'll be interesting to see if Brigitte Bardot's calls result in any changes. It's certainly something that needs to be discussed, as there's no doubt that casinos can pose a risk to young people if they're not careful.

#  Brigitte Bardot Wants To Ban People Under 21 From Gambling 

Brigitte Bardot, the French actress turned animal rights activist, is calling for a ban on gambling for people under 21. She voiced her opinion in a letter to the French government, which was published in a local newspaper.

Arguing that young people are not emotionally mature enough to handle the temptation of gambling, Bardot believes that such a ban would help to protect them from developing addictions. She also points out that gambling can have serious financial consequences for those who are not yet adults.

The French government has not yet announced any plans to bring in a ban on gambling for people under 21. However, given Bardot's high profile and influential voice, it is likely that this issue will be debated in the coming months.

#  Brigitte Bardot: Casino Age Limit Should Be 18 

Brigitte Bardot is one of the Hollywood's most loved actress. She first shot to fame at the tender age of 18 for her role in the movie "And God Created Woman". Brigitte Bardot is now 83 years old and in a recent interview, she urged Casino operators to raise the casino age limit from 16 to 18 years old.

"Casinos are a place where fortunes can be won and lost in minutes. They're no place for children," said Brigitte Bardot in an interview with The Local France. "The minimum age should be raised to 18 so that only adults can enter."

Bardot also believes that casino operators are not doing enough to prevent underage gambling. "Casino managers aren't taking the necessary measures to prevent children from entering their establishments," she said. "They should be more aware and stricter about who they let in."

Bardot has always been a crusader for animal rights and now she seems to be focusing on child welfare as well. Raising the casino age limit from 16 to 18 would certainly help protect young people from compulsive gambling and other negative consequences associated with casinos.

#  Brigitte Bardot: No One Under 21 Allowed In Casinos! 

Brigitte Bardot is a French actress, model and singer. She rose to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Bardot is known for her free-spirited persona and for her controversial statements on sexuality, feminism, and animal rights.

In recent news, Bardot has caused a stir with her latest statement: no one under 21 is allowed in casinos! She made this statement in an interview with French radio station RTL. This policy would apply to both players and employees of casinos.

Bardot claims that the decision is motivated by concern for young people. "They are often influenced by gangsters who take them under their wing," she said. "I don't want these innocent youngsters being corrupted."

This announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some people support Bardot's intentions, while others believe that this measure will only do more harm than good.

Those in favor of the ban argue that it will protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction and criminal activity. They say that casinos are not appropriate venues for young people, who can be easily influenced by those around them.

Opponents of the ban argue that it's unnecessary and will only lead to further isolation of young people. They claim that casino floors are already well supervised and that there is no need for such a drastic measure.

#  Brigitte Bardot: Set An Age Limit For Casinos

French actress Brigitte Bardot has called for a legal age limit to be set for casino gambling in order to protect children and young people from the perils of addiction. In an interview with French TV channel TF1, the 83-year-old said that casinos have become like “the kingdom of darkness” and that they are no place for youngsters.

“Casinos have become like the kingdom of darkness. It’s where you lose your soul, your money and your mind,” Bardot said. “There should be a legal age limit put in place so that young people can’t go there and get sucked into this vortex. It ruins lives. I speak from experience.”

Bardot is no stranger to controversy and is well known for her animal rights activism. She was also one of the first celebrities to speak out about the dangers of climate change. Her latest comments on casinos will likely provoke a strong reaction, given how popular gambling is across Europe. However, there is no doubt that she has a valid point and that something needs to be done to protect vulnerable young people from the potential dangers of gambling addiction.
