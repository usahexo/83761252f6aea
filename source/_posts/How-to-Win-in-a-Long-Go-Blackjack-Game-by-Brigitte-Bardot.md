#  How to Win in a Long Go Blackjack Game by Brigitte Bardot

In blackjack, the object of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on the first two cards, called a "natural", or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. Points are scored by taking cards worth face value, and each card has a corresponding number of points. The Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand.

The player's turn consists of either taking one card ("hit") or not taking a card ("stand"). If the player takes a card and goes over 21 points, they bust and lose the hand. If the player's first two cards are an Ace and a ten-point card (called a "blackjack"), they automatically win the hand regardless of the dealer's upcard.

Players can also choose to double their bet if they have a good hand. This means they get one more card, but they cannot hit again. When doubling down, players must put out twice as much money as their original bet; for example, if you bet $10 on your original hand, you would now have to put $20 on the table in order to double down.

In order to win at blackjack in the long run, you must make smart choices about when to stand and when to take additional cards. If you hit too often, you'll go over 21 and bust; if you stand too often, you'll give the dealer an advantage.

One basic strategy for blackjack is known as "the basic strategy". This is a set of guidelines that tells players which hands to hit and stand on under different circumstances. For example, if your first two cards are 6 and 7, basic strategy says that you should hit because there's a good chance that another card will give you a total of at least 12 - high enough that you'll likely beat the dealer's total score even if they draw another card.

If your first two cards are Ace and 2, basic strategy says that you should stand because there's already a good chance you'll get 21 (or close to it) with just one more card. Of course, basic strategy isn't always perfect - sometimes it makes sense to deviate from it in order to increase your chances of winning. But following basic strategy will give you the best overall chance of winning at blackjack in the long run.

#  How Brigitte Bardot Learned to Win at Blackjack and Now She's Going to Teach You!

Have you ever seen the movie, "Casino"? It's a classic film about Las Vegas, and it features a scene where Robert De Niro's character, Sam "Ace" Rothstein, is teaching Sharon Stone's character, Ginger McKenna, how to play blackjack.

If you're like most people, you probably learned how to play blackjack from watching that scene in "Casino." And if you're like most people, you also probably don't have a clue how to play blackjack correctly.

That's because the rules of blackjack are actually quite complicated. There are plenty of ways to make mistakes while playing blackjack - and those mistakes can cost you a lot of money.

Brigitte Bardot is a professional blackjack player who has mastered the game. And now she's going to teach you how to play blackjack like a pro.

In this article, Brigitte Bardot will explain the basics of blackjack - including how to bet and how to win. She'll also share some tips and tricks that will help you improve your odds of winning at blackjack. So let's get started!

How to Play Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played against the house. The object of the game is to score 21 points or more - without going over 21 points. The player who scores 21 points or more wins the game. If both players score 21 points or more, the game is a draw.

Each player is dealt two cards at the beginning of the game. The player's cards are face-up, and the dealer's cards are face-down. The player then has two options: either take another card (called a hit), or stand (which means that the player doesn't want any more cards).

The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible - without going over 21 points. If the player goes over 21 points, he or she busts and loses the game. Here are some other things to keep in mind while playing blackjack:

* Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what is best for the player.
2 * 10s and face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are all worth 10 points each.  3 * Other cards are worth their face value.  4 * The player can double his or her bet after receiving their first two cards - but only if they think they have a good chance of winning.  5 * If the player splits a pair (two cards of the same rank), he or she receives another card for each split card - and must then decide whether to hit or stand on each hand separately.  6 * If the dealer has an Ace showing, he or she will offer insurance to the players. Insurance costs half of the players bet and pays off 2-1 if the dealer has BlackJack (an Ace and a 10). 

Now that we've gone over basic blackjack rules, let's take a look at some tips and tricks that will help you win more often:



  How to Bet in Blackjack 

When betting in blackjack, there are three things you need to remember:  1) You must bet something before you receive your first two cards;  2) You can never bet more than half your stack; and 3) You can only increase your bet once per round (unless you double down). So for example, if you have $10 in chips and want to bet $5 on your next hand, you would place $5 on top of your chip stack (your original $10 + $5 = $15). Then if you win that hand, you would have $20 in chips ($15 + $5 = $20).
